### Developing on the Eluvio Content Fabric and/or Marketplace

This DApp is built atop the [Eluvio Media Wallet](https://github.com/eluv-io/elv-media-wallet)
library.  It is used for retrieving various information about the user
and their wallet, signing transactions (via built-in custodial signing
or connected non-custodial signing wallets), and operating backend
Marketplace objects.

The Eluvio Media Wallet is available in the Eluvio Wallet Client, documented here:
[Eluvio Wallet Client Documentation](https://eluv-io.github.io/elv-client-js/wallet-client/index.html)

For information about implementing other login options using the wallet and/or frame client, please see
